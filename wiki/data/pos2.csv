History From The Mob to Queensrÿche (1980–1983) ,1
The foundations for Queensrÿche began in the late 1970s.,1
"They covered songs from popular heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, and practiced in the garage of Rockenfield's parents which they called The Dungeon and fitted with egg cartons as acoustic cladding.",1
"Before long, DeGarmo and bassist Eddie Jackson joined Cross+Fire, and the band name was changed to The Mob, after the Black Sabbath song The Mob Rules.",1
"The group recorded the four songs Queen of the Reich, Nightrider, Blinded, and The Lady Wore Black, the latter of which Tate had written the lyrics for.",1
"They reportedly ran out of ideas, and decided to name the band after the first song on their demo tape, Queen of the Reich.",1
"The spelling Queensreich was modified to prevent association of the band with Nazism; ryche is a Middle English cognate to Reich which, like the German word, can mean realm, kingdom or empire.",1
The name Queensrÿche is written with a metal umlaut over the letter 'y'.,1
"The umlaut is used on all of Queensrÿche's releases, except for their 2011 album, Dedicated to Chaos.  ",1
"On the strength of the growing buzz that surrounded them in both the United States and Europe following this review, the Harrises released Queensrÿche's demo tape as a self-titled EP on their independent label 206 Records in 1983.",1
"After the EP garnered international praise, receiving much airplay and selling an unusual number of copies for a small independent release, Tate agreed to leave Myth and become Queensrÿche's permanent lead singer.",1
"On June 29 and 30, 1983, Queensrÿche was the opening act for Zebra in Portland and Seattle respectively.",1

The band's first full-scale U.S. tour (in support of this album) was as the opening act for Kiss on their Animalize tour and Iron Maiden on their World Slavery Tour. ,1
"Rage for Order, released in 1986, introduced a much more polished look and sound for Queensrÿche, while the band was pressured by their management to adopt an image more closely associated with glam metal.",1
"In 1988, Queensrÿche released Operation: Mindcrime, a narrative concept album that proved a massive critical and commercial success.",1
"The band toured through much of 1988 and 1989 with several bands, including Def Leppard, Guns N' Roses and Metallica.",1
The release of Empire (1990) brought Queensrÿche to the height of their commercial popularity.,1
"The subsequent Building Empires tour was the first full-fledged tour to feature Queensrÿche as a headlining act (the band had previously headlined a tour in Japan in support of Operation: Mindcrime, and had headlined a handful of club and theater shows in the U.S. between 1984 and 1988, and the UK in 1988).",1
"As one review noted, After the very commercial, very catchy, and overall very good Empire, Queensryche took a rather abrupt left turn and put out Promised Land...",1
"with many other heavy metal and hard rock acts, Queensrÿche's commercial fortunes waned with the surge in popularity of genres such as alternative rock and grunge (which coincidentally got its start in Seattle, of which Bellevue—where the band was formed—is a suburb).  ",1
"Queensrÿche released their sixth full-length studio album, Hear in the Now Frontier, in March 1997, to mixed critical and fan reception.",1

"The shows were publicly announced on May 29, 2012, revealing that they would focus on Queensrÿche's older work.",1
"Although La Torre was a big fan of Queensrÿche's older albums, he was not very familiar with the songs on Promised Land and they had only limited time to prepare for the shows, the band focused on the material from the Queensrÿche EP to the band's fourth studio album, Empire, which are generally considered the band's heaviest releases, and according to La Torre: are the songs and the time period that most represented the core sound of what Queensryche material was about.",1
" Rockenfield was immediately reassured: the second we played Queen of the Reich, it was all over.  ",1
"The statement announced that Tate lost the brand Queensrÿche to Rockenfield, Wilton and Jackson, who together with La Torre and Lundgren are to be the sole band recording and touring as Queensryche, while former vocalist Tate solely has the right to play Operation: Mindcrime and Operation:",1
"The campaign used the motto Building The Empire, and offered regular pledge rewards such as CDs, exclusive access and equipment, but also an investment opportunity for $50,000 in Queensrÿche Holdings, LLC to accredited investors.",1

"He also used it for the stage set and backdrop of Queensryche's first tour, which he designed.",1
"However, the Tri-Ryche has never been trademarked by Queensrÿche due to a long-standing controversy over who actually created the Tri-Ryche.",1
"Todd Rockenfield, the brother of Queensrÿche's drummer, who designed the typeface of the word Queensryche on the front and back of the EP, claimed the design of the Tri-Ryche in its eventual form was his, and the band acknowledges his role in the development of the Tri-Ryche.",1

"Diamond Head have cited their early inspirations as classic 70s British rock bands such as Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, UFO, Black Sabbath, Judas Priest, Rush and Free, Brian Tatler relating that the first albums he bought were Led Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II and Deep Purple's Machine Head, and said that although a lot of his guitar work was inspired by Ritchie Blackmore and Michael Schenker it was punk rock that showed him that anyone could form a band.",1
"The single, which paired their version of Elvis Presley's",1
Preceding the release of the album was a brief UK tour supporting Ian Hunter & Mick Ronson.,1

"Along with Zeppelin's Led Zeppelin II and Sabbath's Paranoid, In Rock codified the budding heavy metal genre.",1
"Deep Purple are cited as one of the pioneers of hard rock and heavy metal, along with Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.",1
"In December 2015, the band were announced as 2016 inductees into the Hall of Fame, with the Hall stating: Deep Purple's non-inclusion in the Hall is a gaping hole which must now be filled, adding that along with fellow inductees Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath, the band make up the Holy Trinity of hard rock and metal bands.",1
"In their own words, this second album was a tribute to Blue Öyster Cult, an attempt to dissociate from the lo-fi aesthetics of the garage. ",1
Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked a style of psychedelic rock comparable to that of Pink Floyd.,1
"Partially inspired by the psychedelic/progressive bands of the 1970s, such as Pink Floyd, that had dominated the music scene during their youth, the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named The Porcupine Tree.",1
"The album continued the fusion of electronic music and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, Richard Barbieri, of 1970s-80s art rock band Japan, and Colin Edwin. ",1
"Released in 1995, the band's third studio album, The Sky Moves Sideways became a success among progressive rock fans and Porcupine Tree were hailed as the Pink Floyd of the 1990s.",1
"It's true that during the period of The Sky Moves Sideways, I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums any more.",1
"The album benefited from guest appearances by Adrian Belew from King Crimson and Opeth's Mikael Åkerfeldt, and was a commercial success, due in part to Shallow receiving airplay, peaking at number 26 on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.",1
"Porcupine Tree released Deadwing in Japan on 22 March 2006, the first album by the band to be released in that country. ",1

"The most commercially successful line-up was its original, which was a supergroup of four members of different progressive rock bands of the 1970s: lead vocalist and bassist John Wetton of King Crimson and U.K., guitarist Steve Howe of Yes, keyboardist Geoff Downes of Yes and the Buggles, and drummer Carl Palmer of Emerson, Lake & Palmer.",1
"After a few years of inactivity, Billy Sherwood (of Yes, World Trade and Circa:) replaced an ailing Wetton (who passed on shortly thereafter) in Asia for a summer 2017 tour with Journey.",1
"Asia began in early 1981 with the apparent demise of Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, two of the flagship bands of British progressive rock.",1
"After the break-up of King Crimson in 1974, various plans for a supergroup involving bassist John Wetton had been mooted, including the abortive British Bulldog project with Bill Bruford and Rick Wakeman in 1976.",1
"In late December 1980, Wetton and former Yes guitarist Steve Howe were brought together by A&R man John Kalodner and Geffen Records to start writing material for a new album.",1
"They were eventually joined in early 1981 by drummer Carl Palmer, and finally by Howe's fellow member of Yes, keyboardist Geoff Downes.",1
"Two other players auditioned and considered during the band's formation were former The Move and ELO founder Roy Wood and the aforementioned guitarist/singer Trevor Rabin, who would end up replacing Steve Howe in a reformed Yes in 1983.",1
"However, Asia clicked with fans of popular arena acts such as Journey, Boston and Styx; Kalodner had once introduced Wetton to Journey's short-lived frontman Robert Fleischman, with a view to Fleischman becoming Asia's lead singer.",1
Asia's logo and cover art were created by illustrator Roger Dean of Yes and Uriah Heep fame. ,1
Ex-King Crimson and ELP front man Greg Lake replaced Wetton for the highly publicised Asia in Asia,1
"Pat Thrall joined Downes, Palmer and Wetton on tour and they performed classic material, including King Crimson and U.K. songs. ",1

"Yes songs were omitted from this tour's setlist, though Asia also covered Roundabout on earlier legs of the Four Original Members tour.",1
"Yes, although their set list included two songs from the 1980 album Drama, which featured Downes on keys.",1
"It's just me, Geoff [Downes], Steve R[ispin], and Mike Paxman in the studio--- Carl [Palmer] is pretty much all done, Steve H[owe] is half done, and returns to the fold after Yes tour.",1
"On 10 January 2013, Steve Howe announced his retirement from the band to focus on other projects, including Yes, bringing an end to the reunion of the original lineup.",1
"Because I'd just done five years with both bands and then Geoff had joined [Yes] when we did Fly From Here, which is maybe a lot shorter, only a quarter of that time for him.",1
Yes or Asia would extend a tour by a day,1

"While it shared the angry young man outlook and fast tempo of the contemporary mid-1970s' British punk rock movement, in contrast with it the band wore smartly tailored suits reminiscent of English pop-bands in the early 1960s, and incorporated mainstream 1960s rock and R&B influences into its sound, particularly from The Who's work of that period, and also drew influence from the work of the Kinks and the music of American Motown.",1
Up to this point Weller had been playing bass and Foxton had been the band's second guitar player; he persuaded Foxton to take over bass duties and developed a combined lead/rhythm guitar style influenced by the Who's Pete Townshend as well as Dr. Feelgood guitarist Wilko Johnson.,1
