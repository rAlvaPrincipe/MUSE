"Dvořák's appreciation of African-American music is documented: Harry T. Burleigh, a baritone and later a composer, who knew Dvořák while a student at the National Conservatory, said, I sang our Negro songs for him very often, and before he wrote his own themes, he filled himself with the spirit of the old Spirituals.",1
"For its presumed association with African-American music, the quartet was referred to with nicknames such as Negro and Nigger, before being called the American Quartet.",1
"Dvořák wrote (in a letter he sent from America shortly after composing the quartet): As for my new Symphony, the F major String Quartet and the Quintet (composed here in Spillville) – I should never have written these works 'just so' if I hadn't seen America. Listeners have tried to identify specific American motifs in the quartet.",1
"Following Dvořák, a number of American composers turned their hands to the string quartet genre, including John Knowles Paine, Horatio Parker, George Whitefield Chadwick, and Arthur Foote.",1

"Mahler was a late Romantic, part of an ideal that placed Austro-German classical music on a higher plane than other types, through its supposed possession of particular spiritual and philosophical significance.",1
From these antecedents Mahler drew many of the features that were to characterise his music.,1
"Thus, from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony came the idea of using soloists and a choir within the symphonic genre.",1
"The examples of Wagner and Bruckner encouraged Mahler to extend the scale of his symphonic works well beyond the previously accepted standards, to embrace an entire world of feeling.",1
Early critics maintained that Mahler's adoption of many different styles to suit different expressions of feeling meant that he lacked a style of his own; Cooke on the other hand asserts that Mahler redeemed any borrowings by imprinting his [own] personality on practically every note to produce music of outstanding originality.,1
" The music critic Harold Schonberg sees the essence of Mahler's music in the theme of struggle, in the tradition of Beethoven.",1
"However, according to Schonberg, Beethoven's struggles were those of an indomitable and triumphant hero, whereas Mahler's are those of a psychic weakling, a complaining adolescent who ... enjoyed his misery, wanting the whole world to see how he was suffering.",1
"Yet, Schonberg concedes, most of the symphonies contain sections in which Mahler the deep thinker is transcended by the splendour of Mahler the musician.",1
Donald Mitchell writes that Mahler's influence on succeeding generations of composers is a complete subject in itself.,1
" Mahler's first disciples included Arnold Schoenberg and his pupils Alban Berg and Anton Webern, who together founded the Second Viennese School.",1
"Mahler's music influenced the trio's move from progressive tonalism to atonality (music without a key); although Mahler rejected atonality, he became a fierce defender of the bold originality of Schoenberg's work.",1
"At the premiere of the latter's First String Quartet in February 1907, Mahler reportedly was held back from physically attacking the hecklers.",1
"(1923), Berg's Three Pieces for Orchestra (1915) and Webern's Six Pieces (1928)",1
all carry echoes of Mahler's Seventh Symphony.,1
"Among other composers whose work carries the influence of Mahler, Mitchell lists America's Aaron Copland, the German song and stage composer Kurt Weill, Italy's Luciano Berio, Russia's Dmitri Shostakovich and England's Benjamin Britten.",1
The American composers Leonard Bernstein and Samuel Barber were also influenced by Mahler's work.,1
In a 1989 interview the pianist-conductor Vladimir Ashkenazy said that the connection between Mahler and Shostakovich was very strong and obvious; their music represented the individual versus the vices of the world.,1
the first movement of the Cello Symphony of 1963 [which] clearly belongs to that order of dazzling transparency and instrumental emancipation which Mahler did so much to establish.,1
"Mitchell concludes with the statement: Even were his own music not to survive, Mahler would still enjoy a substantial immortality in the music of these pre-eminent successors who have embraced his art and assimilated his techniques.",1
"Yet as his works spanned the golden age of grand opera, clear traces of his influence can be found in the grand operas of Fromental Halévy, Gaetano Donizetti, Giuseppe Verdi and others.",1
"After 1850, Huebner notes a continuing tradition of operas at Paris where 'principals appear with chorus at the end of an act and where private intrigue conjoins a well-articulated public dimension in the plot' and cites amongst others Charles Gounod's La nonne sanglante (1854), Ambroise Thomas's Hamlet and operas by Jules Massenet, amongst them Le roi de Lahore (1877) and Le Cid (1885).",1
The line of succession was however virtually washed away in the tide of Wagner in Paris after 1890 (see below).,1
"The influence of Meyerbeer has also been detected in the operas of Antonín Dvořák and other Czech composers, and in the operas of Russian composers including Rimsky-Korsakov and the young Tchaikovsky, who thought Les Huguenots 'one of the greatest works in the repertoire'.",1
Perhaps the most elaborate and substantial of these is Franz Liszt's monumental Fantasy and Fugue on the chorale ,1
", ad salutarem undam, S. 259 (1852), for organ or pédalier, based on the chorale of the Anabaptist priests in Le prophète and dedicated to Meyerbeer.  ",1
The work was also published in a version for piano duet (S. 624) which was much later arranged for solo piano by Ferruccio Busoni. ,1
"Liszt also wrote piano works based on Robert le diable, notably the Réminiscences de Robert le diable  subtitled Valse infernale.  ",1
"He also transcribed two pieces from L'Africaine, as Illustrations de l'opéra L'Africaine.",1
"Frédéric Chopin and Auguste Franchomme jointly composed a Grand duo concertant on themes from the opera, for cello and piano, in 1832, and the Italian pianist and composer Adolfo Fumagalli composed an elaborate fantasy on the opera for left hand alone as his Op. 106.",1
Other pieces based on the opera included works by Adolf von Henselt and Jean-Amédée Méreaux.,1
The Nutcracker is one of the composer's most popular compositions.,1
"The Trepak, or Russian dance, is one of the most recognizable pieces in the ballet, along with the Waltz of the Flowers and March, as well as the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.",1
"Tchaikovsky studied the music of specialists such as the Italian Cesare Pugni and the Austrian Ludwig Minkus, before setting to work on Swan Lake. ",1
"Tchaikovsky most admired the ballet music of such composers as Léo Delibes, Adolphe Adam, and later, Riccardo Drigo.",1
"He would later write to his protégé, the composer Sergei Taneyev, I listened to the Delibes ballet Sylvia ...",1
"I was ashamed, for if I had known of this music then, I would not have written Swan Lake.",1
"Tchaikovsky most admired Adam's 1844 score for Giselle, which used the Leitmotif technique: associating certain themes with certain characters or moods, a technique he would use in Swan Lake, and later, The Sleeping Beauty. ",1
Tchaikovsky drew on previous compositions for his Swan Lake score.,1
"This ballet included the famous Leitmotif, the Swan's Theme or Song of the Swans.",1
"He also made use of material from The Voyevoda, an opera he had abandoned in 1868.",1
"The Grand adage (a.k.a. the Love Duet) from the second scene of Swan Lake was fashioned from an aria from that opera, as was the Valse des fiancées from the third scene.",1
Another number which included a theme from The Voyevoda was the Entr'acte of the fourth scene. ,1
"The opening moonrise scene, highlighted by a wordless chorus, uses techniques similar to that of Maurice Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé (1912).  ",1
"The novel has been adapted into a number of other forms, including theatre, film, television - and at least two full-length operas, by John Joubert (1987–1997) and Michael Berkeley (2000).",1
"Some sketches of the Symphony No. 2 date back to 1903, a letter from October of that year indicating an idea for a symphony in E-flat major to be dedicated to his friend and conductor Hans Richter.",1
"The symphony was set aside during the composition of In the South, Symphony No. 1, and the Violin Concerto.",1
"Robert Meikle draws attention to the Mahlerian treatment of the material in the last movement, as well as likenesses to Brahms's A German Requiem.",1
"Meikle also notes the similarities to certain aspects of Brahms's Symphony No. 3, in particular the cyclical return of thematic material and the subdued texture which concludes both works.",1
"The motive in the first violins at rehearsal 1 of the first movement, reappearing in both the rondo and the finale, resembles both Elgar's own so-called Judgment theme from The Dream of Gerontius and the Dies irae.",1
"An inverted chord appears at the conclusion of the work, and Allen Gimbel illustrates many possible links between this symphony and Wagner's Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg, a work Elgar admired deeply.",1
The music quotes Anton Bruckner's Symphony No. 7.  ,1
"In the program notes to the score, Rouse commented on his inspirations and the use of Bruckner, saying, In my Symphony No. 1",1
"I have attempted to pay conscious homage to many of those I especially admire as composers of adagios -- Shostakovich, Sibelius, Hartmann, Pettersson, and Schuman, for example -- but only one is recognizably quoted (the famous opening theme from the second movement of Bruckner's Symphony No. 7, played both in the original and here by a quartet of Wagner Tubas).",1
The period of Dvořák’s life that culminated with his Symphony No. 6 in D major was a time of experimentation and development of his personal compositional style.  ,1
"In 1863, Richard Wagner came to Prague and conducted a program of his own works, in which Dvořák played as a violist.  ",1
"On the panel of judges that awarded Dvořák the prize was Johannes Brahms, who became a longtime friend and supporter of the young Czech.",1
And in Prague itself was the older and more revered Czech nationalistic composer Bedřich Smetana who eventually supported Dvořák by being among the first to program and conduct concerts that included his compositions.  ,1
"In 1880, with the composition of his Sixth Symphony, Dvořák had at last achieved an optimum balance between his nationalistic-romantic proclivities and the demands of classical form.",1
"Yet, it may not be quite so simple to categorically say that a mix or balance of these influences culminated in Symphony No. 6.  ",1
"The orchestral makeup, the key, the mood and the tempo marking of the Finale are all identical to the finale of Brahms's Second Symphony.",1
"It shares certain features with other Sturm and Drang symphonies of this time, and is likely inspired by Haydn's Symphony No. 39, also in G minor.",1
"The orchestra did not play well—with only one rehearsal before the concert—and at one point, following a mistake by one of the performers in the Choral Fantasy, Beethoven had to stop the music and start again.",1
"However, a year and a half later, publication of the score resulted in a rapturous unsigned review (actually by music critic E. T. A. Hoffmann) in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung.",1
"The Hungarian film Overture by János Vadász, which won the 1965 Cannes Film Festival's Short Film Palme d'Or, uses the complete Egmont Overture as the soundtrack for a series of images featuring a hatching bird and was described as among the most ingenious pairings of music and image in the history of the festival.",1
"This includes some of the works by Ralph Vaughan Williams, Dmitri Shostakovich and Samuel Barber (amongst many others).",1
"The cello itself gained particular attention during this inter-war period, with the composition of several cello pieces such as Prokofiev's Cello Concerto and Shostakovich's pair of Cello Concertos, as well as Kabalevsky's own.",1
"The composer Erkki-Sven Tüür, said about the performance: I was carried beyond.",1
"The work is among Grieg's earliest important works, written by the 24-year-old composer in 1868 in Søllerød, Denmark, during one of his visits there to benefit from the climate. ",1
The concerto is often compared to the Piano Concerto of Robert Schumann: it is in the same key; the opening descending flourish on the piano is similar; and the overall style is considered to be closer to Schumann than any other single composer.,1
"Grieg had heard Schumann's concerto played by Clara Schumann in Leipzig in 1858, and was greatly influenced by Schumann's style generally, having been taught the piano by Schumann's friend Ernst Ferdinand Wenzel. ",1
"Grieg's concerto provides evidence of his interest in Norwegian folk music; the opening flourish is based on the motif of a falling minor second (see interval) followed by a falling major third, which is typical of the folk music of Grieg's native country.",1
"This specific motif occurs in other works by Grieg, including the String Quartet No. 1.",1
The composition freely quotes passages from Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto.  ,1
"In early discussions with Emanuel Ax, I discovered that he had never publicly performed (and had no future plans to perform)",1
"the piano concerto of Robert Schumann, a work he deeply loved but which he felt, due to his extraordinary modesty, unable to do justice to.",1
The title of the piece comes from the song Seeing in the Moby Grape album Moby Grape '69.  ,1
"As I came upon the Moby Grape entry, I discovered that Skip Spence had for some time been institutionalized as irretrievably psychotic, and this led me to reflect further upon Robert Schumann's own institutionalization for psychosis.",1
"The concerto has been compared to the music of fellow French composer Camille Saint-Saëns, specifically his Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor.  ",1
"In the CD liner notes to conductor Juanjo Mena's recording of the Piano Concerto with the BBC Philharmonic, music critic Gerald Larner expanded on the Saint-Saëns comparison, saying:Dedicated to Marie-Aimée Roger-Miclos, well known as an interpreter of the music of Saint-Saëns, it was modelled on that composer's already popular Piano Concerto No. 2 in G minor, Op. 22. ",1
"However, the work has also been suggested by Larner and BBC Music Magazine critic Christopher Dingle as inspiration for the works of Sergei Rachmaninoff.  ",1
"They were intended in a general way to evoke the traditions of Celtic, especially Irish, folk music but to couch the musical utterance in what I hoped would seem a more spiritual, even metaphysical, maner through the use of extremely slow tempi, perhaps not unlike some of the recordings of the Irish singer Enya. ",1
"Twenty-five years after Handel's death, a Handel Commemoration was initiated in London by George III in 1784, with five concerts in Westminster Abbey and the Pantheon.",1
They were described in detail by the contemporary musicologist and commentator Charles Burney in 1785.,1
"Three years later Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart incorporated the Musette from Op. 6, No. 6, and a short Largo from Op.",1
"6, No. 7, into his reorchestration of Acis and Galatea, K 566.Like Handel's organ concertos, in the nineteenth century his concerti grossi Op",1

"In the twentieth century, Arnold Schoenberg, a composer openly antipathetic to Handel but at a turning point in his musical career, freely arranged the Concerto Grosso, Op. 6, No. 7, in his Concerto for string quartet and orchestra (1933).",1
"For more information about the selected works, visit the Philip Glass page.",1
"Its conception is similar to that of Rouse's 1988 percussion ensemble piece Bonham, a tribute to rock drummers and named after Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham.",1
"Thunderstuck directly references the 1978 Jay Ferguson song Thunder Island, which partially inspired the work's title.  ",1
David Allen of The New York Times has also compared the piece to the music of Jefferson Airplane.,1
"Kanneh-Mason has cited the prominent cellists Jacqueline du Pré and Mstislav Rostropovich as his musical heroes, alongside Bob Marley.",1
"Like Sullivan, and unlike Johann Strauss II, he was consistently blessed with workable subjects and genuinely witty librettos.",1
A frequent characteristic of Offenbach's word setting was the nonsensical repetition of isolated syllables of words for comic effect; an example is the quintet for the kings in La belle Hélène: ,1
"The musicologist and Offenbach specialist Jean-Christophe Keck notes that when larger orchestras were available, either in bigger Paris theatres or in Vienna or elsewhere, Offenbach would compose, or rearrange existing music, accordingly.",1
"When they were available he wrote for cor anglais, harp, and, exceptionally, Keck records, an ophicleide (Le Papillon), tubular bells (Le carnaval des revues), and a wind machine (Le voyage dans la lune).Hughes describes Offenbach's orchestration as always skilful, often delicate, and occasionally subtle.",1
"He slipped the banned revolutionary anthem La Marseillaise into the chorus of rebellious gods in Orphée aux enfers, and quoted the aria Che farò from Gluck's Orfeo in the same work; in La belle Hélène he quoted the patriotic trio from Rossini's Guillaume Tell and parodied himself in the ensemble for the kings of Greece, in which the accompaniment quotes the rondeau from Orphée aux enfers.",1
"In Croquefer (1857), one duet consists of quotations from Halévy's La Juive and Meyerbeer's Robert le Diable and Les Huguenots.",1
"Even in his later, less satirical period, he included a parodic quotation from Donizetti's La fille du régiment in La fille du tambour-major.",1
"Other examples of Offenbach's use of incongruity are noted by the critic Paul Taylor: In La belle Hélène, the kings of Greece denounce Paris as 'un vil séducteur' to a waltz tempo that is itself unsuitably seductive ...",1
Offenbach followed suit in a series of 20 operettas; the conductor and musicologist Antonio de Almeida names the finest of these as La fille,1
"Pitchfork called Russell a changeling artist whose only parallel might be Miles Davis, constantly placing his individual sound in new contexts, constantly searching.",1

"Stockhausen's two early Electronic Studies (especially the second) had a powerful influence on the subsequent development of electronic music in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly in the work of the Italian Franco Evangelisti and the Poles Andrzej Dobrowolski and Włodzimierz Kotoński (Skowron 1981, 39).",1
"The influence of his Kontra-Punkte, Zeitmasse and Gruppen may be seen in the work of many composers, including Igor Stravinsky's Threni (1957–58) and Movements for piano and orchestra (1958–59) and other works up to the Variations:",1
"In Memoriam (1963–64), whose rhythms are likely to have been inspired, at least in part, by certain passages from Stockhausen's Gruppen",1
"(Stravinsky and Craft 1980, 133) Amongst British composers, Sir Harrison Birtwistle readily acknowledges the influence of Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (especially on his two wind quintets, Refrains and Choruses and Five Distances) and Gruppen on his work more generally (Cross 2000, 48; Cross 2001; Hall 1984, 3, 7–8; Hall 1998, 99, 108; Pace 1996, 27).",1
"Brian Ferneyhough says that, although the technical and speculative innovations of Klavierstücke I–IV, Kreuzspiel and Kontra-Punkte escaped him on first encounter (Ferneyhough 1988), they nevertheless produced a sharp emotion, the result of a beneficial shock engendered by their boldness (Ferneyhough 1988) and provided an important source of motivation (rather than of imitation) for my own investigations (Ferneyhough 1988).",1
"While still in school, he became fascinated upon hearing the British première of Gruppen, and listened many times to the recording of this performance, while trying to penetrate its secrets—how it always seemed to be about to explode, but managed nevertheless to escape unscathed in its core—but scarcely managed to grasp it.",1
"Although it eventually evolved in a direction of its own, Ferneyhough's 1967 wind sextet, Prometheus, began as a wind quintet with cor anglais, stemming directly from an encounter with Stockhausen's Zeitmaße (Kohl 2017, 137).",1
"In a short essay describing Stockhausen's influence on his own work, Richard Barrett concludes that Stockhausen remains the composer whose next work I look forward most to hearing, apart from myself of course and names as works that have had particular impact on his musical thinking Mantra, Gruppen, Carré, Klavierstück X, Inori, and Jubiläum (Barrett 1998). ",1
"French composer and conductor Pierre Boulez once declared, Stockhausen is the greatest living composer, and",1
"Boulez also acknowledged the influence of performing Stockhausen's Zeitmaße on his subsequent development as a conductor (Boulez 1976, 79–80).",1
"Another French composer, Jean-Claude Éloy, regards Stockhausen as the most important composer of the second half of the 20th century, and cites virtually all his catalog of works as a powerful discoveration  [sic], and a true revelation (Éloy 2008). ",1
Dutch composer Louis Andriessen acknowledged the influence of Stockhausen's Momente in his pivotal work Contra tempus of 1968 (Schönberger 2001).,1

"That year Villa-Lobos also met the French composer Darius Milhaud, who was in Rio as secretary to Paul Claudel at the French Legation.",1

"In the 1920s, Villa-Lobos also met the Spanish guitarist Andrés Segovia, who commissioned a guitar study: the composer responded by writing a set of twelve such pieces, each based on a tiny detail or figure played by Brazilian itinerant street musicians (chorões), transformed into a étude that is not merely didactic.",1
"The music of chorões also provided the initial inspiration for his Chôros, a series of compositions written between 1920 and 1929.",1

"Page is seen as the logical extension of [bassist] Pops Foster, an influential bassist known for his dependable timekeeping.",1
"Band mate Eddie Durham recalls how Page helped make the double bass a viable alternative to bass horns, such as the tuba: ",1
"Jazz critic Gunther Schuller notes describes some of Page's other stylistic contributions: For the bass functions simultaneously on several levels: as a rhythm instrument; as a pitch instrument delineating the harmonic progression; and, since the days of Walter Page, as a melodic or contrapuntal instrument.",1
"Page was also famous for his restraint, a lesson fellow bassist Gene Ramey recounts: There's a whole lot",1
"He did, however, contribute to the legitimacy of the double bass as a melodic instrument, open[ing] the door for virtuosos like [Duke Ellington Orchestra bassist] Jimmy Blanton to garner more respect for the instrument, through improvisation.",1

The work of Charles Mingus has also received attention in academia.,1
"According to Ashon Crawley, the musicianship of Charles Mingus provides a salient example of the power of music to unsettle the dualistic, categorical distinction of sacred from profane through otherwise epistemologies.",1
"Crawley offers a reading of Mingus that examines the deep, imbrication uniting Holiness-Pentecostal aesthetic practices and jazz.",1
Mingus recognized the importance and impact of the midweek gathering of black folks at the Holiness-Pentecostal Church at 79th and Watts in Los Angeles that he'd attend with his stepmother or his friend Britt Woodman.,1
" Emphasis is placed on the ethical demand of the prayer meeting felt and experienced that, according to Crawley, Mingus attempts to capture.",1
"In many ways, Wednesday Night Prayer Meeting was Mingus's memorial, homage, to black sociality.",1
"By exploring Mingus' homage to black Pentecostal aesthetics, Crawley expounds on how Mingus figured out that those Holiness-Pentecostal gatherings were the constant repetition of the ongoing, deep, intense mode of study, a kind of study wherein the aesthetic forms created could not be severed from the intellectual practice because they were one and also, but not, the same.",1
"Gunther Schuller has suggested that Mingus should be ranked among the most important American composers, jazz or otherwise.",1
"In 1988, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts made possible the cataloging of Mingus compositions, which were then donated to the Music Division of the New York Public Library for public use.",1

" In the manner of Adrian Willaert's madrigals, he also explored distant tonal regions, while avoiding jarring harmonic progressions.",1
"Wert's style at mid-career began to change away from the Rore manner towards one more closely aligned with the Venetians, such as Andrea Gabrieli.",1
"His music during this period was influenced by the other composers working in Ferrara, including Luzzasco Luzzaschi, and his favorite poets of the time were those most closely associated with Ferrara – Tasso and Guarini.",1
"The most famous of these is the Missa Da pacem Domine which was long attributed to Josquin des Prez (and included in the Smijers complete works edition of Josquin, 1953).  ",1
"Bauldeweyn's style shows both the contrapuntal manner of the late 15th century, archaic by the time he was writing, with occasional harsh dissonance and unblended textures, as well as the pervasive imitation and canonic writing techniques of the generation of Josquin des Prez and his successors.  ",1
"The models include works by Josquin, Cipriano de Rore, Thomas Crecquillon, and Lassus.  ",1
"The motets are similar in style to those of Nicolas Gombert, with dense textures, pervasive imitation, and free treatment of the source material.",1
"Surviving reliably attributed works include some 14 masses (including a Requiem), an isolated Credo (Credo sine nomine), five motets, a motet-chanson (a deploration on the death of Binchois), and 21 chansons.",1
His Missa pro Defunctis is the earliest surviving polyphonic Requiem mass (a possibly earlier setting by Dufay has been lost).,1
"The Missa Caput is almost certainly an early work, since it follows on an anonymous English mass of the same title dated to the 1440s, and his late masses may include the Missa Ma maistresse and Missa Fors",1
"In his remaining masses, including the Missa Mi-mi, Missa cuiusvis toni, and Missa prolationum, no borrowed material has been found, and the works seem to have been freely composed.",1
"Ockeghem would sometimes place borrowed material in the lowest voice, such as in the Missa Caput, one of three masses written in the mid-15th century based on that fragment of chant from the English Sarum Rite.",1
A strong influence on Josquin des Prez and the subsequent generation of Netherlanders,1
"Two of the most famous contrapuntal achievements of the 15th century include his Missa prolationum, which consists entirely of mensuration canons, and the Missa cuiusvis toni, designed to be performed in any of the different modes, but even these technique-oriented pieces demonstrate his uniquely expressive use of vocal ranges and tonal language.",1
"To commemorate his death, Josquin des Prez composed the motet La déploration de la mort de Johannes Ockeghem, a setting of the poem Nymphes des bois by Jean Molinet.",1
Some of the authors of these poems included Molinet and Desiderius Erasmus; Johannes Lupi provided another musical setting.,1
"De Orto's book of masses followed after those by Josquin, Jacob Obrecht, Antoine Brumel, Johannes Ghiselin, Pierre de La Rue, and Alexander Agricola.",1

"The catalogue of the library of John IV of Portugal, which listed only about a third of the contents of that colossal collection, one of the largest libraries of the age, gives well over 200 works, all of which were destroyed in the Lisbon earthquake and fire of 1755.  ",1
"It makes use of canon, and is based on a motet by Francisco Guerrero. ",1
"Ghersem's music was loved by both Philips of Spain as well as John IV of Portugal, and Italian music theorist and writer Pietro Cerone praised him effusively in his massive and chaotic work El melopeo y maestro of 1613.",1
"During the 1540s and 1550s there were two general types of chansons being composed:  the Parisian, by composers such as Clément Janequin and Claudin de Sermisy, which tended to be homophonic and written in short phrases, with only brief periods of imitation; and the Franco-Flemish, which was more polyphonic and imitative:  ",1
"Some of Canis's chansons use a cantus-firmus technique, in which Canis takes a line or two of music from a pre-existing chanson, including examples by Janequin, Claudin de Sermisy, and Gombert, and reworks it in a contrapuntal texture much different from the original, but using the same words.",1
"Ashfield represented the Royal College of Organists, working initially in partnership with William Cole, of the Associated Board, and Gerald Knight, director of the Royal School of Church Music, he helped to provide a series of recommendations.",1
"He was also a member of the council of the Royal College of Organists, Fellow of the Guild of Church Musicians and a special commissioner of the Royal School of Church Music.",1
The Italian guitarist-composer Mauro Giuliani used the theme as the basis for his Variazioni su un tema,1
"The German composer Louis Spohr used the theme as the basis for a variation movement in his Octet in E major, Op. 32. ",1

"In his 1974 album Todd, Todd Rundgren performs the Lord Chancellor's Nightmare Song (When you're lying awake...).",1
"In the 1999 film Topsy-Turvy, a scene depicts Fanny Ronalds (played by Eleanor David) facetiously introducing it as a new composition at an 1884 party at her house; she then sings it with Sullivan (Allan Corduner) at the piano and Walter Simmonds (Matthew Mills) at the harmonium.",1
There are clear parallels between King Arthur and Shakespeare's The Tempest (which Dryden had revised in line with Restoration taste in collaboration with Sir William Davenant in 1667 and which had been turned into a semi-opera with music by Matthew Locke in 1674). ,1
"The Four-Part Mass, which according to Joseph Kerman was probably the first to be composed, has a more specific debt to earlier Tudor settings, a debt which has become apparent since Philip Brett observed that it is partly modelled on the Mean Mass by John Taverner (c. 1490–1545), a highly regarded setting which Byrd would probably have sung as a choirboy in the 1550s.",1
"In drawing material from Taverner's Mean Mass Byrd was following in the footsteps of Christopher Tye, John Sheppard and Thomas Tallis, who had all used it as models for Mass cycles of their own.",1
"Jacob Obrecht, Johannes Ockeghem, and an anonymous composer once thought to be Guillaume Dufay.  ",1
"Many of the pieces use a contrapuntal and textural style reminiscent of the Italian madrigal, especially the pieces for five and six voices: in particular he imitated the style of Marenzio, whose works were well known in England, having made up a large part of Nicholas Yonge's 1588 Musica transalpina, which started the vogue for madrigals in England. ",1
"Opinions have ranged from those of Hugh MacDiarmid, who called him a complete wash-out; F. R. Leavis, who wrote that Auden's ironic style was self-defensive, self-indulgent or merely irresponsible; and Harold Bloom, who wrote Close thy Auden, open thy [Wallace] Stevens, to the obituarist in The Times, who wrote: W.H. Auden, for long the enfant terrible of English poetry… emerges as its undisputed master.",1
" Auden's propagandistic poetic plays, including The Dog Beneath the Skin and The Ascent of F6, and his political poems such as Spain gave him the reputation as a political poet writing in a progressive and accessible voice, in contrast to Eliot; but this political stance provoked opposing opinions, such as that of Austin Clarke who called Auden's work liberal, democratic, and humane, and John Drummond, who wrote that Auden misused a characteristic and popularizing trick, the generalized image, to present ostensibly left-wing views that were in fact confined to bourgeois experience.",1
He has stated that he has been influenced by the styles of Andrés Segovia and Francisco Tárrega. ,1
"working at Rare, Wise soon gained wide attention and acclaim for his work on the Donkey Kong Country game series.",1
"In the January 1996 issue of Electronic Gaming Monthly, Wise stated that his travelling experiences largely shaped the sound and mood of each Donkey Kong soundtrack, further saying that the music for Donkey Kong Country 2:",1
He has also composed the soundtrack for the Game Boy Advance port of Donkey Kong Country 3: Dixie Kong's Double Trouble!. ,1
"In late October 2009, it was announced by the OverClocked ReMix community that Wise was remixing a track for Serious Monkey Business, an unofficial Donkey Kong Country 2 remix album.",1
"Grant Kirkhope and Robin Beanland also collaborated on this track, playing guitar and trumpet respectively.",1
"Much like his contribution to Serious Monkey Business, Wise later remixed his own composition, the GBA version of Jungle Jitter, for an unofficial Donkey Kong Country 3 remix album titled Double the Trouble!, which was released on 1 December 2012.",1
"In June 2013, it was announced that he would be composing for Donkey Kong Country:",1
Wise also composed for Yooka-Laylee along with Kirkhope and Steve Burke.,1
"Brahms maintained a classical sense of form and order in his works, in contrast to the opulence of the music of many of his contemporaries.",1
"Thus, many admirers (though not necessarily Brahms himself) saw him as the champion of traditional forms and pure music, as opposed to the New German embrace of programme music. ",1
"Brahms venerated Beethoven; in the composer's home, a marble bust of Beethoven looked down on the spot where he composed, and some passages in his works are reminiscent of Beethoven's style.",1
"Brahms's First Symphony bears strongly the influence of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, as the two works are both in C minor and end in the struggle towards a C major triumph.",1
"The main theme of the finale of the First Symphony is also reminiscent of the main theme of the finale of Beethoven's Ninth, and when this resemblance was pointed out to Brahms he replied that any dunce could see that.",1
"Indeed, the similarity of Brahms's music to that of late Beethoven had first been noted as early as November 1853 in a letter from Albert Dietrich to Ernst Naumann.",1
Brahms was a master of counterpoint. ,1
"For Brahms, ... the most complicated forms of counterpoint were a natural means of expressing his emotions, writes Geiringer.",1
"As Palestrina or Bach succeeded in giving spiritual significance to their technique, so Brahms could turn a canon in motu contrario or a canon per augmentationem into a pure piece of lyrical poetry.",1
 Writers on Brahms have commented on his use of counterpoint.,1
"For example, of Op. 9, Variations on a Theme by Robert Schumann, Geiringer writes that Brahms displays all the resources of contrapuntal art.",1
"In the A major piano quartet Opus 26, Jan Swafford notes that the third movement is demonic-canonic, echoing Haydn's famous minuet for string quartet",1
"Swafford further opines that thematic development, counterpoint, and form were the dominant technical terms in which Brahms... thought about music.",1
The Hungarian Dances are among Brahms's most-appreciated pieces.,1
"consummate skills in counterpoint and rhythm are richly present in A German Requiem, a work that was partially inspired by his mother's death in 1865 (at which time he composed a funeral march that was to become the basis of Part Two, Denn alles Fleisch), but which also incorporates material from a symphony which he started in 1854 but abandoned following Schumann's suicide attempt.",1
Brahms loved the classical composers Mozart and Haydn.,1
"He studied the music of pre-classical composers, including Giovanni Gabrieli, Johann Adolph Hasse, Heinrich Schütz, Domenico Scarlatti, George Frideric Handel, and, especially, Johann Sebastian Bach.",1
"His friends included leading musicologists, and, with Friedrich Chrysander, he edited an edition of the works of François Couperin.",1
Brahms also edited works by C. P. E. Bach and W. F. Bach.,1
He looked to older music for inspiration in the art of counterpoint; the themes of some of his works are modelled on Baroque sources such as Bach's The Art of Fugue in the fugal finale of Cello Sonata No. 1 or the same composer's Cantata No. 150 in the passacaglia theme of the Fourth Symphony's finale.  ,1
Peter Phillips (2007) hears affinities between Brahms's rhythmically charged contrapuntal textures and those of Renaissance masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and William Byrd.  ,1
"Amaryllis dance, Philips remarks that “the cross-rhythms in this piece so excited E. H. Fellowes that he likened them to Brahms's compositional style.",1
"early Romantic composers had a major influence on Brahms, particularly Schumann, who encouraged Brahms as a young composer.",1
"During his stay in Vienna in 1862–63, Brahms became particularly interested in the music of Franz Schubert.",1
"The latter's influence may be identified in works by Brahms dating from the period, such as the two piano quartets Op. 25 and Op. 26, and the Piano Quintet which alludes to Schubert's String Quintet and Grand Duo for piano four hands.",1
"The influence of Chopin and Mendelssohn on Brahms is less obvious, although occasionally one can find in his works what seems to be an allusion to one of theirs",1
"(for example, Brahms's Scherzo, Op. 4, alludes to Chopin's Scherzo in B-flat minor; the scherzo movement in Brahms's Piano Sonata in F minor, Op. 5, alludes to the finale of Mendelssohn's Piano Trio in C minor).Brahms considered giving up composition when it seemed that other composers' innovations in extended tonality resulted in the rule of tonality being broken altogether.",1
"Although Wagner became fiercely critical of Brahms as the latter grew in stature and popularity, he was enthusiastically receptive of the early Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel; Brahms himself, according to many sources, deeply admired Wagner's music, confining his ambivalence only to the dramaturgical precepts of Wagner's theory. ",1
"Brahms wrote settings for piano and voice of 144 German folk songs, and many of his lieder reflect folk themes or depict scenes of rural life.",1
"Staden was highly acclaimed as a teacher; he was instrumental in creating the Nuremberg tradition and his most important pupil, Johann Erasmus Kindermann",1
", would carry that tradition through Georg Caspar Wecker and Heinrich Schwemmer to the Krieger brothers and, ultimately, to Johann Pachelbel, who studied under both Wecker and Schwemmer.",1
"Other pupils of Staden included three of his sons (Johann, Adam and Sigmund Theophil Staden) and miscellaneous lesser Nuremberg composers.",1
"Apart from establishing the so-called Nuremberg school through training young musicians, Staden's activities in Nuremberg during the 1620s-30s included evaluating new music dedicated to the city (this included Samuel Scheidt's Geistliche Concerten of 1634).",1
"Most of his music is in the Venetian polychoral style, which uses numerous voices divided into several groups.",1
"Choir sizes range from 8 to 20, with the voices divided into two, three or four groups, and he must have had well-trained and sophisticated musicians at his disposal, considering both the amount and the difficulty of music he wrote for these ensembles. ",1
"Among his students were Johann Adam Reincken, his successor at the St. Catharine Church in Hamburg, and (possibly) Dieterich Buxtehude.",1
"Because of his travels and his ability to absorb various national styles and incorporate them into his music, Froberger, along with other cosmopolitan composers such as Johann Kaspar Kerll and Georg Muffat, contributed greatly to the exchange of musical traditions in Europe.",1
"Froberger's compositions were known to and studied by, among many others, Johann Pachelbel, Dieterich Buxtehude, Georg Muffat and his son Gottlieb Muffat, Johann Caspar Kerll, Matthias Weckmann, Louis Couperin, Johann Kirnberger, Johann Nikolaus Forkel, Georg Böhm, George Handel and Johann Sebastian Bach.",1
"The profound influence on Louis Couperin made Froberger partially responsible for the change Couperin brought into the French organ tradition (as well as for the development of the unmeasured prelude, which Couperin cultivated). ",1
"Indeed, he established the form almost single-handedly and, through innovative and imaginative treatment of standard dance forms of the time, paved the way for Johann Sebastian Bach's elaborate contributions to the genre (not to mention almost every major composer in Europe, since the vast majority composed suites and were influenced by the French style exemplified by Froberger).",1
"One of the last middle Baroque composers, Pachelbel did not have any considerable influence on most of the famous late Baroque composers, such as George Frideric Handel, Domenico Scarlatti or Georg Philipp Telemann.",1
"However, he did influence Johann Sebastian Bach indirectly; the young Johann Sebastian was tutored by his older brother Johann Christoph Bach, who studied with Pachelbel, but although J.S. Bach's early chorales and chorale variations borrow from Pachelbel's music, the style of northern German composers, such as Georg Böhm, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Adam Reincken, played a more important role in the development of Bach's talent.",1
"Pachelbel's influence was mostly limited to his pupils, most notably Johann Christoph Bach, Johann Heinrich Buttstett, Andreas Nicolaus Vetter, and two of Pachelbel's sons, Wilhelm Hieronymus and Charles Theodore.",1
"Composer, musicologist and writer Johann Gottfried Walther is probably the most famous of the composers influenced by Pachelbel – he is, in fact, referred to as the second Pachelbel in Mattheson's Grundlage einer Ehrenpforte.",1
"In the first half of the 19th century, some organ works by Pachelbel were published and several musicologists started considering him an important composer, particularly Philipp Spitta, who was one of the first researchers to trace Pachelbel's role in the development of Baroque keyboard music.",1
"Much of Pachelbel's work was published in the early 20th century in the Denkmäler der Tonkunst in Österreich series, but it was not until the rise of interest in early Baroque music in the middle of the 20th century and the advent of historically-informed performance practice and associated research that Pachelbel's works began to be studied extensively and again performed more frequently.",1
"He wrote these pieces for Sundays and church feast days; their structure and intent foreshadowed the later German church cantata, as exemplified most famously by Johann Sebastian Bach.  ",1
"Some of his music uses the massive Venetian polychoral style, especially that written before the Thirty Years' War.  ",1
"It was his Musices poeticae which gained him his fame, and his resulting reputation lasted at least until the 18th century; this treatise was influential on three of the most famous German Baroque treatises of all, the Syntagma musicum (1618) of Michael Praetorius, the Critica musica (1722-1723) of Johann Mattheson, and Johann Gottfried Walther's Musicalisches Lexicon of 1732. ",1
"It is the first in a German Baroque tradition of comparison of musical devices with rhetorical devices, an idea which was to be later expanded by Joachim Burmeister and Mattheson. ",1
"(in this Nucius is one of the first music theorists to recognize the powerful musical use of silence, an idea which was to attain fame in modern times in the work of John Cage), and syncopatio (syncopation, for rhythmic enhancement).  ",1
"He considered John Dunstaple to be the earliest composer of expressive music (though earlier music may not have been available to him), and other composers he wrote about included Gilles Binchois, Antoine Busnois, Johannes Ockeghem, Heinrich Isaac, Ludwig Senfl, Josquin des Prez, and of course Lassus.

"While some of his book is based on previous writings by Heinrich Glarean and Franchinus Gaffurius, the section on the rhetorical devices in music is original, and signifies the rapidly changing practice during the transitional period between Renaissance and Baroque styles.",1
"In particular, he used well-defined concertino, ritornello, and cadenzas in his ensemble music, following and further developing a practice initiated in the music of Giovanni Gabrieli and the other composers of his generation.",1
"Some of his music is reminiscent of the concertato style of Giovanni Gabrieli, and a modern sense of tonality prevails throughout. ",1
His secular music includes madrigals and canzonettas; some were famous enough to be anthologized by Thomas Morley in England.,1
"In this regard it resembles that of some of his contemporaries, including the madrigalists Gesualdo, Sigismondo d'India, Pomponio Nenna, and Giovanni de Macque, although Pari avoids the extreme chromaticism used by Gesualdo and never attained his fame. ",1
"His style varies from diatonic to chromatic, and is comparable to that of contemporary monodist Sigismondo d'India in its experimental qualities. ",1
"His experimental idiom first attracted the attention of musicologists, and later, performers; his compositions are now recorded relatively frequently, often on collections containing works of other composers of the same era, such as Monteverdi or Alessandro Grandi.",1
"He uses double choirs in a homophonic texture, a style descended from the early Baroque Venetian School, rarely writing imitatively.",1
"His operas have a remarkably strong sense of dramatic effect as well as a great musical facility, and a grotesque humour which was characteristic of Italian grand opera down to the death of Alessandro Scarlatti.",1
"Cavalli's operas provide the only example of a continuous musical development of a single composer in a single genre from the early to the late 17th century in Venice — only a few operas by others (e.g., Monteverdi and Antonio Cesti) survive.",1
"In addition to operas, Cavalli wrote settings of the Magnificat in the grand Venetian polychoral style, settings of the Marian antiphons, other sacred music in a more conservative manner – notably a Requiem Mass in eight parts (SSAATTBB), probably intended for his own funeral – and some instrumental music.",1
"His works include fourteen published operas, of which two survive, La Flora (1628) set to a libretto by Andrea Salvadori and La Dafne (1608).",1
"La Dafne was praised as the best setting of the libretto by Rinuccini—even by Jacopo Peri, the first to write an opera on the text.  ",1
"Peri indicated that Gagliano's way of setting text to music came closer to actual speech than any other, therefore accomplishing the aim of the Florentine Camerata of decades before, who sought to recapture that (supposed) aspect of ancient Greek music. ",1
"some of his sacred music is a cappella, again in the prima prattica style of the previous century, while other pieces show influence of the Venetian School. ",1
"By far his most famous composition, and one of the most significant operas of the early Baroque, is his setting of the life of fifth-century Saint Alexis, Il Sant'Alessio.  ",1

"Gustave Reese, in his encyclopedic Music of the Renaissance, never mentions him, yet Alfred Einstein, in his comprehensive The Italian Madrigal, praised him as being the finest of the nobleman-composers at the end of the 16th century, a category that would include Gesualdo as well as Alessandro Striggio. ",1
"This style was harmonious with the tastes of the Roman School composers, performers, and listeners, who were more conservative than the esoteric Ferrara school, and unaccustomed to its experimental music.",1
"Stylistically they conform to the typical practice of divided choirs and groups of instruments used by the other composers at St. Mark's (see Venetian polychoral style, concertato).",1
"As could be expected for a composer of the Roman School, his sacred music was conservative, and mostly in the Palestrina style for the first part of his career; however, after 1600 he experimented with some of the stylistic innovations which defined the beginning of the Baroque era, such as the concertato principle and the basso continuo.  ",1
"(The Encyclopedia Americana may contradict this, writing that a Editio Medicæa of the Graduale of 1614 was created by Felice Anerio.) ",1
"For a Roman School composer and a priest he wrote a surprising amount of secular music, mostly madrigals and canzonettas, some of which are in a light-hearted style influenced by northern Italian models, or by Luca Marenzio, who had spent time in Rome.  ",1
"All of the lines of development in the madrigal in the late century can be traced to ideas first seen in Rore; according to Alfred Einstein, his only true spiritual successor was Claudio Monteverdi, another revolutionary.  ",1
"In his sacred music, however, Rore was more backward-looking, showing his connection to his Netherlandish roots: his masses, for example, are reminiscent of the work of Josquin des Prez.",1
"This piece has been recorded by the Huelgas Ensemble, led by Paul Van Nevel.",1
"The major influences on Guami's sacred music style are from Willaert, his teacher at St. Mark's, and Cipriano de Rore, and later from Lassus; indeed the two composers may have been friends since they served together in Munich and evidently traveled together.",1
"In his secular music he was most progressive, using an unusual amount of chromaticism and modulation to distant keys, undoubtedly influenced by Nicola Vicentino. ",1
"Guami also wrote numerous instrumental canzonas; most likely he wrote organ music which has been lost (only one piece survives, in a collection by Girolamo Diruta).",1
"Guami was also important as a teacher, providing instruction to composers such as Adriano Banchieri, one of the key figures in the transition to the Baroque style.",1
"Vincenzo Galilei, the progressive music theorist, lutenist, and  father of the astronomer, also wrote about Guami's music, talent and fame.",1
"Perissone was one of the followers of Willaert in the early time of development of the Italian madrigal, the period referred to by Alfred Einstein as the madrigal's age of innocence.  ",1
"Even though he was a personal friend, he was not significantly influenced by fellow Willaert student Cipriano de Rore, the principal figure in madrigal composition in the 1550s, and whose style marked an extraordinary increase in expressive intensity of the secular vocal form.",1
"Some other individual madrigals appear in collections by others, particularly Cipriano de Rore, and Perissone wrote a dedicatory letter for one of Rore's books, but only in the alto part-book (Perissone was probably an alto).  ",1
"Donato represented a progressive trend in the Venetian school, which was already a progressive tradition compared to the other major contemporary Italian musical styles (especially as compared to the Roman School).  ",1
"The progressive trend in the Venetian school was represented by composers such as Donato, Giovanni Croce, and Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli; the conservative trend involved composers and theorists such as Zarlino, Cipriano de Rore, and Claudio Merulo, who tended to follow the Franco-Flemish style which was predominant almost everywhere else in Europe until after mid-century. ",1
"Croce wrote less music in the grand polychoral style than Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli, although he left a grand mass for four choirs, composed for Ferdinand of Austria (the future Emperor Ferdinand II) and several triple-choir Psalm settings (only one of which has survived), and as a result his music has not maintained the same fame to the present day; however he was renowned as a composer at the time, and had a large influence on music both in Italy and abroad.  ",1
"As a composer of sacred music he was mostly conservative, writing cori spezzati in the manner of Adrian Willaert, and parody masses more like the music composed by the members of the contemporary Roman School.  ",1
"Stylistically, Croce was more influenced by Andrea Gabrieli than his nephew Giovanni, even though they were exact contemporaries; Croce preferred the emotional coolness, the Palestrinian clarity and the generally lighter character of Andrea's music.  ",1
Croce's music remained popular in England and Thomas Morley specifically singled him out as a master composer; indeed Croce may have been the biggest single influence on Morley.,1
John Dowland visited him in Italy as well.,1
"His keyboard music was hugely influential, and his ideas can be seen in the music of Sweelinck, Frescobaldi and others; because of the immense influence of Sweelinck as a teacher, much of the virtuoso keyboard technique of the north German organ school, culminating in Johann Sebastian Bach, can claim to be descended from the innovations of Merulo. ",1
"Since he was a member of what is known today as the Venetian School, he also wrote motets for double choir in the manner of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli.",1
"The famous essay of keyboard technique Il Transilvano (1593), by Girolamo Diruta, was dedicated to Merulo, indicating his status as one of the most important keyboard players of the Italian Renaissance.",1
"Not only did Charpentier compose during that transitory period so important to the evolution of musical language, where the modality of the ancients and the emerging tonal harmony coexisted and mutually enriched one another (Catherine Cessac, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, 2004 edition, p. 464), but he also was a respected theoretician.",1
"The two versions survive as copies in the hand of Étienne Loulié, Charpentier's colleague, who called them Règles de Composition par Monsieur Charpentier and Augmentations tirées de l’original de",1
"Tommaso Traetta produced two operas setting translations of Rameau libretti that show the French composer's influence, Ippolito ed Aricia (1759) and I Tintaridi (based on Castor et Pollux, 1760).",1
"Traetta had been advised by Count Francesco Algarotti, a leading proponent of reform according to French models; Algarotti was a major influence on the most important reformist composer, Christoph Willibald Gluck.",1
"Gluck's three Italian reform operas of the 1760s—Orfeo ed Euridice, Alceste, and Paride ed Elena—reveal a knowledge of Rameau's works.",1
"For instance, both Orfeo and the 1737 version of Castor et Pollux open with the funeral of one of the leading characters who later comes back to life.",1
Many of the operatic reforms advocated in the preface to Gluck's Alceste were already present in Rameau's works.,1
"Hector Berlioz investigated Castor et Pollux and particularly admired the aria Tristes apprêts, but whereas the modern listener readily perceives the common ground with Berlioz' music, he himself was more conscious of the gap which separated them.",1
" In 1894, composer Vincent d'Indy founded the Schola Cantorum to promote French national music; the society put on several revivals of works by Rameau.",1
"Among the audience was Claude Debussy, who especially cherished Castor et Pollux, revived in 1903: Gluck's genius was deeply rooted in Rameau's works...",1
"Camille Saint-Saëns (by editing and publishing the Pièces in 1895) and Paul Dukas were two other important French musicians who gave practical championship to Rameau's music in their day, but interest in Rameau petered out again, and it was not until the late 20th century that a serious effort was made to revive his works.",1
"Over half of Rameau's operas have now been recorded, in particular by conductors such as John Eliot Gardiner, William Christie, and Marc Minkowski.",1
"At the same time Rebelo knows how to evoke the Roman School polyphony, like is in seven-part motet Panis angelicus, full of harmonic false relations or in his Lamentationes, in which the composer achieves effects through the use of piercing chromatic harmonies. ",1
"As Paul Van Nevel says regarding Rebelo's music: “For him, music was an absolute art with its own ideas that were not necessarily connected to any text (…).",1
"(root motions of fourths or fifths being somewhat more common than in, for example, Gombert or Palestrina), and a free use of harmonic cross-relations rather like one hears in English music of the time, for example in Thomas Tallis.  ",1
"Peñalosa was one of the most famous Spanish composers of the generation before Cristóbal de Morales, and his compositions were highly regarded at the time.  ",1
"Peñalosa was evidently fond of contrapuntal puzzles and canons, as evidenced by the quodlibet, and by the Agnus Dei of his Missa Ave Maria peregrina, which combines a plainsong tune with a retrograde (backwards) version of a famous secular song by Hayne van Ghizeghem. ",1
"One of his motets (Sancta mater istud agas) was long assumed to be by Josquin des Prez, which indicates both the stylistic similarity of their music and the high quality of Peñalosa's.",1
"Ricardo was influenced by fellow flamenco players, including: Pinto, Torre, El Niño Gloria, Escacena, and Antonio Mairena.",1
"He was inspired by the great threesome of flamenco guitar; Ramón Montoya, Manolo de Huelva, and Javier Molina, by whom he was guided at the start of his professional career in the Salon Variedades in Seville.",1

"His motet Clamabat autem mulier Cananea was particularly praised by his contemporaries, and served as the source for instrumental pieces by later composers, namely Alonso Mudarra.",1
"Senfl was an eclectic composer, at home both in the worlds of sacred and secular music, and he modeled his style carefully on models provided by the Franco-Flemish composers of the previous generation, especially Josquin des Prez.",1
"Le Petit's style is similar to that of Antoine de Févin and Jean Mouton, the two most famous French composers associated with the French royal chapel.  ",1
Le Petit was listed by Pierre Moulu in his famous motet Mater,1
"The former of these was used as a basis for mass settings by other composers, including Johannes Martini and Jacob Obrecht.",1
More of Rogier's music remains than that of his compatriot Géry de Ghersem.  ,1
"Stylistically they recall music written fifty years before, particularly the elaborate polyphonic style of Nicolas Gombert, another member of the Habsburg chapel.  ",1

"(De tous biens plaine, by Hayne van Ghizeghem, was the first).  ",1
"Unification of a mass by cantus firmus writing was not to occur for another decade at least, most likely in England: Grossin was one of the first, after Johannes Ciconia, to sense the need for musical unity in the several movements and accomplish it by use of a type of motto theme.",1
"Eloy d'Amerval mentioned Basiron in 1508 as among the 20 great composers of the 15th century; both Pierre Moulu and theorist Gaffurius praised him highly; and most famously, poet Guillaume Crétin, in his Déploration sur le trépas de Jean Ockeghem, listed Basiron among the sweetly singing angels in heaven welcoming Ockeghem to join them.",1
"Everything that he wrote can be dated to the period between 1554 and 1569.His motets, his only known sacred works, are for four and five voices and show the influence of Jean Maillard.  ",1
"The style of Mouton's music has superficial similarities to that of Josquin des Prez, using paired imitation, canonic techniques, and equal-voiced polyphonic writing: yet Mouton tends to write rhythmically and texturally uniform music compared to Josquin, with all the voices singing, and with relatively little textural contrast.",1
"He also influenced posthumously the outstanding music theorist Gioseffo Zarlino, himself a pupil of Willaert, who referred to him, somewhat enthusiastically as his precettore.",1
"In addition to the programmatic chansons for which he is most famous, he also wrote short and refined compositions more in the style of Claudin de Sermisy.",1
"French composer Jehan Alain composed a piece for organ based on a theme by Janequin (Variations sur un thème de Clément Janequin, 1937)",1
"One of them became extraordinarily famous: Je suis deshéritée was widely distributed, and composers as diverse as Jean Maillard in France, Nicolas Gombert in the Habsburg chapel and the Low Countries, Orlande de Lassus in Bavaria, and Palestrina in Italy all used it as source material for masses later in the century.",1
"Cadéac's musical style originated from the homophony and simplicity prevalent in the 1530s, especially in the Parisian chanson at the time of Clément Janequin, with clear diction, short phrases, general avoidance of dense polyphony, and abundant parallel imperfect intervals.  ",1

"Verdelot, along with Costanzo Festa, is considered to be the father of the madrigal, an a cappella vocal form which emerged in the late 1520s from a convergence of several previous musical streams (including the frottola, the canzone, the laude, and also including some influence from the more serious style of the motet). ",1
"Most of his masses are based on chansons, including works by Antoine Busnois, Alexander Agricola, Guillaume Dufay, Loyset Compère, and himself. ",1
"Some of them have been attributed to other composers, including Adrian Willaert, Jean Mouton, and Philippe Verdelot.  ",1
"Du Caurroy was a late practitioner of the style of musique mesurée, the musical method of setting French verse (vers mesurés) in long and short syllables, to long and short note values, in a homophonic texture, as pioneered by Claude Le Jeune under the influence of Jean-Antoine de Baïf and his Académie de musique et de poésie.  ",1
"In this same book, Mersenne held that Du Caurroy was the finest composer of musique mesurée, outranking even the renowned Claude Le Jeune. ",1
"The collection of 42 such pieces, published posthumously in 1610, is considered to be a strong influence on the next generation of French keyboard players, especially Jean Titelouze, the founder of the French organ school.",1
"These works are all parody masses, and are based on motets by Pierre Certon, Thomas Crecquillon and Jean Maillard.  ",1
"In his formative years, Varèse was greatly impressed by Medieval and Renaissance music – in his career, he founded and conducted several choirs devoted to this repertoire – as well as the music of Alexander Scriabin, Erik Satie, Claude Debussy, Hector Berlioz and Richard Strauss.",1
"There are also clear influences or reminiscences of Stravinsky's early works, specifically Petrushka and The Rite of Spring, on Arcana.",1
"Varèse taught many prominent composers including Chou Wen-chung, Lucia Dlugoszewski, André Jolivet, Colin McPhee, James Tenney, and William Grant",1
"His Psalm settings, however, are more polyphonic, characteristic of the moderate contrapuntal style exemplified by the chansons of Jacques Arcadelt, an approximate contemporary. ",1
"While he never achieved the fame of Claude Le Jeune, part of this may have been due to Mersenne's failure to publish his complete works, a project which he promised but never completed.  ",1

"Except for the origin of their tunes, they are very similar to some of the psalm settings by the Huguenot composer Claude Goudimel, who had been killed by Catholics in the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre a decade earlier.",1
"Sergei Prokofiev admired the composer, and his Visions fugitives bears great likeness to Scriabin's tone and style.",1
"Aaron Copland praised Scriabin's thematic material as truly individual, truly inspired, but criticized Scriabin for putting this really new body of feeling into the strait-jacket of the old classical sonata-form, recapitulation and all, calling this one of the most extraordinary mistakes in all music.

"The work of Nikolai Roslavets, unlike that of Prokofiev and Stravinsky, is often seen as a direct extension of Scriabin's.",1
"Roslavets was not alone in his innovative extension of Scriabin's musical language, however, as quite a few Soviet composers and pianists such as Samuil Feinberg, Sergei Protopopov, Nikolai Myaskovsky, and Alexander Mosolov followed this legacy until Stalinist politics quelled it in favor of Socialist Realism.",1

"Wagner's idealism of ancient Greece was common among his romantic intellectual circle (for example, his Dresden friend the architect Gottfried Semper wrote to demonstrate the ideal qualities of classical Greek architecture).",1
"Although Wagner at the time imagined his intended operas to constitute the 'perfect Art-works' mentioned in this essay and described further in The Artwork of the Future and Opera and Drama, with the aim of redeeming society through art, in the event practicality superseded the naive ideas (and shallow historical interpretation) expressed in these essays.",1

"The essay, the first of a series of polemical blasts from Wagner in the years 1849  to 1852, which included  The Artwork of the Future and Jewishness in Music, indeed provided fuel to those who wished to characterize Wagner as an impractical and/or eccentric radical idealist. ",1

"His frottolas, by far the largest and most historically significant part of his output (176 in all) are more varied than those of the other famous frottolist, Marchetto Cara, and they also tend to be more polyphonic than is typical for most frottolas of the time; in this way they anticipate the madrigal, the first collections of which began to be published near the very end of Tromboncino's life, and in the city where he lived",1

"That one of the frottolas was published by Petrucci only one year after the invention of music printing shows the esteem in which it was held, at least by that Venetian printer; Alfred Einstein, writing in The Italian Madrigal, describes the same piece (Segue cuor e non restare)",1
"At least one of his madrigals appears in a Roman print by Andrea Antico dated 1537, an anthology of madrigals for three voices which includes works by Jacques Arcadelt and Costanzo Festa.  ",1

"His compositions in the first book of 1554 show most directly the influence of Cipriano de Rore, the most renowned mid-century composer of madrigals, who was then the maestro di cappella in Ferrara for Duke Ercole II d'Este.  ",1
"Fiesco's compositions in this book are for four voices, and include madrigals in the classic style, chromatically experimental works (for example Bacio soave, which shows also the influence of Nicola Vicentino, who actively encouraged such experiments), as well as music likely intended for performance at dramatic events staged for the Este family.

"First, Brahms sought to have his waltzes performed in informal musical evening settings similar to those intended for Schubert's dances.",1

"Also, a specific request by Brahms to have each of his movements copied onto a separate sheet of paper demonstrates, to an extent, his uncertainty of how to order such seemingly unrelated pieces.",1
Brahms's experience in editing Schubert's Twenty Ländler is important in understanding the ideas of influence relevant to 19th century composers.,1
"This experience was merely editorial, as Brahms used his own compositional and aesthetic preferences to organize pieces that Schubert never intended to be performed together into a coherent order.",1
"Due to the initial, unrelated nature of these dances, Brahms was able to extend the work of an admired predecessor by, in a sense, making original work out of those pieces which already existed, therefore reverting the direction of influence from successor back to predecessor.",1
